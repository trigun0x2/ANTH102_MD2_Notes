### Defining and Classifying Health Problems
_ethnomedicine_: study of cross-cultural health systems

* Health systems encompasses perception, classification of health problems,
prevention, diagnosis, healing and healers

_Western biomedicine (WBM)_: healing approach using technology

* manth study disease-illness dichotomy where they show how both disease and illness must both be understood within a cultural context

_disease_: biological health problem (broken bones, viral infection)
_illness_: culturally specific perception of a health problem

* Basis for classifying health problems:
    * _vector_: means of transmission
    * affected body part
    * symptoms

* Elders medical knowledge down through oral traditions (stories, songs, etc.)
    > Boil was getting bigger. <br>
    > Her husband told her to bathe. <br>
    > She got into the water. <br>
    > She disappeared. <br>
    > -- Cool story bro

```Ruby
Culture: Subanun
Researcher: Frake 1961
Location: Mindanao, Philippines

Horticulturists living where even young children had substantial knowledge about health problems
Had many specificities of health problems
Skin problems were common
```

* In WBM lots panels of experts decide on classification and publish it in large books
* WBM focuses on western health problems and ignores other cultures

_culture-specific syndrome_: health problem specific to a culture. Often due to factors such as stress, fear, shock etc.

_Somatization_: process where the body absorbs social stress and manifests symptoms of suffering

_susto_: fright/shock disease. Can be caused by loss of loved ones, etc. Symptoms include lack of appetite, no motivation, nightmares, etc.

* People usually experience susto after experiencing a sense of failure
* All cultures experience some sort of cultural specific syndromes

#### Culture specific syndromes

### Ethno-Etiologies

_ethno-etiology_: cross-culturally specific causal explanation for health problems

* Some casual causes include, environment (wind, etc.), gender, food, psychosocial, spirits

_structural suffering_: health problems caused by poverty, war, famine, etc.

* Things such as Sufriendo del agua (lack of access to water) causes anxiety because the women will never know if they can cook or wash clothes. In Mexico, 1/3 of people lack the access to clean water

### Healing Ways
_community healing_: healing with social context. In public domain.

* Non-Western biomedicine tends to use community healing.

```Ruby
Culture: Ju/'hoansi
Location: Kalahari Desert, Africa

Uses community energy to heal
All night healing dance, sit around fire, sing. People that need healing dance around.
```

* This community healing __works__ on several levels. Strengthens the afflicted mentally
* Everyone can be a healer in this community

_Humoral healing_: healing by balancing natural elements within the body
* Food/drugs gives 'heating', 'cooling' properties
* Humoral healing practiced in Middle East, and much of Asia
* You have to balance heat and coolness to live healthily

_shamans_: Using spirits to heal
* Different cultures have different healers
* Some healers are disappearing because of hospitals and such (i.e. midwives)
* Criteria for a healer:
    - Selection
    - Training
    - Certification
    - Professional image
    - Exception of payment
_Phytotherapy_: healing using plants
* Coca masks hunger, gastrointestinal problems, sprains, colds, swelling
* Minerals are used for healing populars like in water, and mud
* Radon gases in US mines are also used
* Pharmaceutical medicine is becoming popular

### Three Theoretical Approaches
#### Ecological/Epidemiological Approach
_Ecological/Epidemiological Approach_: how environment interacts with culture to cause health problems

* Researchers should focus on environmental effects
* Research method tends to be etic and quantitative
* Work environment might be a factor (rice workers in China)
* Settled population is more likely than mobile population to get health problems
* Cities are more crowded and main cause diseases to spread easier
* Major diseases in the New World because indigenous people were not immune:
    - Smallpox
    - Measles
    - Malaria
* Fking Europeans dominating the world made a lot of people depressed

_Historical trauma_: intergenerational transfer of emotions due to those European colonialism assholes

#### Interpretivist Approach
_Interpretivist Apparoch_: health system as systems of meaning

* Examples include rituals, and symbolic performances
* The idea is to provide meaning for when people are suffering for seemingly meaningless things
* This is also known as placebo effect in western culture

_placebo effect_: positive result from a healing method that's non-material

* Placebo effects works may be due to confidence of the specialist, act of the prescription and details of the pill

#### Critical Medical Anthropology
_Critical Medical Anthropology_: study of how social, media and political issues affect the health problems, health system, access to health care, etc.

manth = medical anthropologist
