## Chapter 5

### Defining and Classifying Health Problems
_ethnomedicine_: study of cross-cultural health systems

* Health systems encompasses perception, classification of health problems,
prevention, diagnosis, healing and healers

_Western biomedicine (WBM)_: healing approach using technology

* manth study disease-illness dichotomy where they show how both disease and illness must both be understood within a cultural context

_disease_: biological health problem (broken bones, viral infection)
_illness_: culturally specific perception of a health problem

* Basis for classifying health problems:
    * _vector_: means of transmission
    * affected body part
    * symptoms

* Elders medical knowledge down through oral traditions (stories, songs, etc.)
    > Boil was getting bigger. <br>
    > Her husband told her to bathe. <br>
    > She got into the water. <br>
    > She disappeared. <br>
    > -- Cool story bro

```Ruby
Culture: Subanun
Researcher: Frake 1961
Location: Mindanao, Philippines

Horticulturists living where even young children had substantial knowledge about health problems
Had many specificities of health problems
Skin problems were common
```

* In WBM lots panels of experts decide on classification and publish it in large books
* WBM focuses on western health problems and ignores other cultures

_culture-specific syndrome_: health problem specific to a culture. Often due to factors such as stress, fear, shock etc.

_Somatization_: process where the body absorbs social stress and manifests symptoms of suffering

_susto_: fright/shock disease. Can be caused by loss of loved ones, etc. Symptoms include lack of appetite, no motivation, nightmares, etc.

* People usually experience susto after experiencing a sense of failure
* All cultures experience some sort of cultural specific syndromes

#### Culture specific syndromes

### Ethno-Etiologies

_ethno-etiology_: cross-culturally specific causal explanation for health problems

* Some casual causes include, environment (wind, etc.), gender, food, psychosocial, spirits

_structural suffering_: health problems caused by poverty, war, famine, etc.

* Things such as Sufriendo del agua (lack of access to water) causes anxiety because the women will never know if they can cook or wash clothes. In Mexico, 1/3 of people lack the access to clean water

### Healing Ways
_community healing_: healing with social context. In public domain.

* Non-Western biomedicine tends to use community healing.

```Ruby
Culture: Ju/'hoansi
Location: Kalahari Desert, Africa

Uses community energy to heal
All night healing dance, sit around fire, sing. People that need healing dance around.
```

* This community healing __works__ on several levels. Strengthens the afflicted mentally
* Everyone can be a healer in this community

_Humoral healing_: healing by balancing natural elements within the body
* Food/drugs gives 'heating', 'cooling' properties
* Humoral healing practiced in Middle East, and much of Asia
* You have to balance heat and coolness to live healthily

_shamans_: Using spirits to heal
* Different cultures have different healers
* Some healers are disappearing because of hospitals and such (i.e. midwives)
* Criteria for a healer:
    - Selection
    - Training
    - Certification
    - Professional image
    - Exception of payment
_Phytotherapy_: healing using plants
* Coca masks hunger, gastrointestinal problems, sprains, colds, swelling
* Minerals are used for healing populars like in water, and mud
* Radon gases in US mines are also used
* Pharmaceutical medicine is becoming popular

### Three Theoretical Approaches
#### Ecological/Epidemiological Approach
_Ecological/Epidemiological Approach_: how environment interacts with culture to cause health problems

* Researchers should focus on environmental effects
* Research method tends to be etic and quantitative
* Work environment might be a factor (rice workers in China)
* Settled population is more likely than mobile population to get health problems
* Cities are more crowded and main cause diseases to spread easier
* Major diseases in the New World because indigenous people were not immune:
    - Smallpox
    - Measles
    - Malaria
* Fking Europeans dominating the world made a lot of people depressed

_Historical trauma_: intergenerational transfer of emotions due to those European colonialism assholes

#### Interpretivist Approach
_Interpretivist Apparoch_: health system as systems of meaning

* Examples include rituals, and symbolic performances
* The idea is to provide meaning for when people are suffering for seemingly meaningless things
* This is also known as placebo effect in western culture

_placebo effect_: positive result from a healing method that's non-material

* Placebo effects works may be due to confidence of the specialist, act of the prescription and details of the pill

#### Critical Medical Anthropology
_Critical Medical Anthropology_: study of how social, media and political issues affect the health problems, health system, access to health care, etc.

_medicalization_: labeling an issue as a medical problem when it actually is not

* This leads to prescription to treat poverty, to treat the inability to provide for one's family
* Poverty is the primary cause of sickness and death
* Mo money, mo food
* Most nutrition programs treat the health issues instead of the cause
* Medicalization also occurs in poor countries
* WBM should reply less on technology and take social structures into account. Also WBM should try alternative methods such as message, acupuncture etc.
* WBM may feel/seem like an assembly to produce the perfect baby, more of a machine model
* Medical students are trained to accept the machine model in three ways:
    - Hazing, where med students are sleep deprived and stressed
    - Cognitive retrogression, where a large amount of info in school overwhelms critical thinking
    - Dehumanization, erase humanitarian ideals through emphasis on tech

### Globalization and Change

* Healing methods are moving around the world, so are health problems
* People travel is promoting AIDS/HIV, SARS. Deforestation is promoting malaria

_disease of development_: health problems caused by increased economic development projects

* Building dams and irrigation systems causes schistosomoiasis. The larvae for schistosomoiasis strive in stagnant water
* Ironically obesity is a problem in developed countries

_medical pluralism_: presence of multiple health systems within a society

* This allows the client to choose and an increase in quality of health but can also cause confusion and conflict in ideas

```Ruby
Culture: Sherpa
Location: Nepal

Three ways of healing:
    Lamas for blessings and humoral healing
    Shamanic practitioners for divination ceromonies
    Biomedical practitioners
```
* Cultural misunderstanding in healing can occur. I.e. number of meals means different things, ways of healing differ

_Applied medical anthropology_: application of anthro to further goals of health-care providers.

* Anthropologist helped investigate causes of health issues in a culture and also how to remedy the problem
* Robert Trotter helped US find lead in azarcon which was then banned in Mexico. He also helped come up with a substitute and advertise it in an culturally effective way
* Anthropologist can help develop more meaningful messages for health educators

## Chapter 6

### 3 Major Points
* Kinship bonds have different definitions
* An house-hold/house have different definitions and is changing
* Marriage/kinship etc is all changing due to globalization and modernization

### How Cultures Create Kinship

_kinship system_: Predominant form of kin relationships

* Blood-based system initially
* There are various terminologies for kinship relations depending on the culture
* There are two different types of descents:
    - Bilineal: counts are both parent's child
        + Usually foraging and industrialism
    - Unilineal: counts as only one parent's child
        + Horticulture, Pastoralism, Agriculture
        + Patrilineal: only male count as kinship lineage
        + Matrilineal: only female count as kinship lineage

* Kinship forms through food sharing
* Kinship can also be formed through adoption. It is now official
    - Open Adoption: where you know the original parents
    - Closed Adoption: Vise-versa
* Fostering: Temporarily living with another family
* In some cultures children is not a kin until ritually defined (Catholics, Mayans)

#### Marriage

* Marriage have different definitions depending on the culture
* New marriage between same sex, cross-gender etc is now being accepted
* Most cultures have incest taboo

_endogamy_: marriage within a particular group

_parallel cousins_: offspring of one's father's brother or one's mother's sister

_cross-cousin_: offspring of one's father's sister or one's mother's brother

* These cousin marriages are favored among some Middle East and northern  Africa people

_exogamy_: marriage outside of a defined social group
    - marrying up
    - marrying down
* Gifts are often given between couples during marriage
    - Woman to man: dowry
    - Man to woman: brideprice, or brideservice
* Monogramy: marriage between 2 people
* Polygramy: marriage between lots of people (gets intense)
* Polygyny: man -> multi-women
* Polyandry: woman -> multi-men, only recorded in Nepal

_nuclear household_: One adult couple with/without kids

_extended household_: More than one adult married couple

* More sex = more happiness
* Siblings sometimes act as a parent figure
* Age of marriage is rising
* People want "white weddings"
* Cost for grooms is rising. Weddings costing more / brides want more
* New forms of households:
    - MUltigenerational: adults kids in parent's homes
