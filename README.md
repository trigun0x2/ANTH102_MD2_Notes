### Defining and Classifying Health Problems
_ethnomedicine_: study of cross-cultural health systems

* Health systems encompasses perception, classification of health problems,
prevention, diagnosis, healing and healers

_Western biomedicine (WBM)_: healing approach using technology

* manth study disease-illness dichotomy where they show how both disease and illness must both be understood within a cultural context

_disease_: biological health problem (broken bones, viral infection)
_illness_: culturally specific perception of a health problem

* Basis for classifying health problems:
    * _vector_: means of transmission
    * affected body part
    * symptoms

* Elders medical knowledge down through oral traditions (stories, songs, etc.)
    > Boil was getting bigger. <br>
    > Her husband told her to bathe. <br>
    > She got into the water. <br>
    > She disappeared. <br>

_culture-specific syndrome_: health problem specific to a culture. Often due to factors such as stress, fear, shock etc.

_Somatization_: process where the body absorbs social stress and manifests symptoms of suffering

_susto_: fright/shock disease. Can be caused by loss of loved ones, etc. Symptoms include lack of appetite, no motivation, nightmares, etc.

* People usually experience susto after experiencing a sense of failure
* All cultures experience some sort of cultural specific syndromes

### Ethno-Etiologies

_ethno-etiology_: cross-culturally specific causal explanation for health problems

* Some casual causes include, environment (wind, etc.), gender, food, psychosocial, spirits

_structural suffering_: health problems caused by poverty, war, famine, etc.

* Things such as Sufriendo del agua (lack of access to water) causes anxiety because the women will never know if they can cook or wash clothes. In Mexico, 1/3 of people lack the access to clean water
